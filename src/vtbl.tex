\begin{frame}{Virtual Tables} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Support dynamic dispatching(run-time method binding).
        \item When a virtual method it is defined, the compiler adds a hidden member variable to the class that defines this virtual method.
        \item This hidden member variable points to a \emph{Virtual Method Table(VTable)}, this is usually an array of pointers.
        \item At run time these pointers will be set to point to the right function. 
        \item At compile time it is not yet known if the base function is to be called or a derived one implemented  by a class that inherits from the base class.
    \end{itemize}
